We use the data that we have about  you to provide and personalize our Services, including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our Services (including ads) can be more  relevant and useful to you and others.
        </p>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">2.1 Services</h5>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">2.1.1 Connecting Professionals</h5>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients,  and other professional contacts. To do so, you can &quot;connect&quot; with the professionals who  you choose, and who also wish to &quot;connect&quot; with you. Subject to your and their settings,  when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each other&acute;s  connections in order to exchange professional opportunities. 
        </p>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided  through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile,  suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job  experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you.  You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for  certain tasks.
        </p>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or  allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect  with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g.,  name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person  you invited. You can choose whether or not to share your own list of contacts with your  connections.

        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
        Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding  professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also  allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have  about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services  and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services  for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our  Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us  know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will  use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain  members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new  skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to  provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your preferences and  settings, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took  a social action, used a feature, made new connections or were mentioned in the news.

Your profile can be found by those looking to  hire (for a job or a specific task) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend  jobs or mentees, show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a  company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You  can signal that you are interested and share information with recruiters. We will use  your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated  systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more  relevant to our Members, Visitors and Users.

        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">2.2 Premium Services</h5>

          <li>Information from advertising partners, vendors and publishers; and </li>
          <li>Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to  infer industry, seniority; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using  device data to recognize you as a Member).</li>
        </ul>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          We will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored  content, except that they are labelled as advertising (e.g., as &quot;ad&quot; or &quot;sponsored&quot;). If you  take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is  associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to  your settings, if you take a social action on our Services, that action may be mentioned  with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and  photo when their sponsored content is shown. 
        </p>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">Advertisement Choices</h5>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          We adhere to self-regulatory principles for interest-based advertising and participate in  industry opt-outs from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you  will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self-regulatory tools.  You can also opt-out specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you  more relevant ads.  
        </p>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">Info to Ad Providers</h5>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks  except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers; (ii) with your separate  permission/consent or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile).  However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a  signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use  of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate  personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device  identifiers received from us. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such  advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so.  
        </p>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">2.5 Marketing</h5>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>

        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>

          Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive  their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide  these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members  outside of our Services.
        </p>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">3.3 Others&acute; Services</h5>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          Subject to your <span className = "privacyPolicyLink">settings</span>, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link  your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The  sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen  when you opt to link the accounts. Third-party services have their own privacy policies,  and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may,  at your discretion revoke the link with such accounts.
        </p>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          Subject to your <span className = "privacyPolicyLink">settings</span>, excerpts from your profile will appear on the services of others  (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile  data of the person they are meeting or messaging, social media aggregators, talent and  lead managers). &quot;Old&quot; profile information remains on these services until they update  their data cache with changes you made to your profile.
        </p>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">3.4 Related Services </h5>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services.  We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For  example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning  history.
        </p>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">3.5 Service Providers</h5>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit,  payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your  information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are  obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.
        </p>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">3.6 Legal Disclosures</h5>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law,  subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is  reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or  actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our  agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims  or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or (5) exercise or  protect the rights and safety of Nexdro, our Members, personnel or others.
        </p>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when  appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request  is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that  the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to  challenge every demand.
        </p>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">3.7 Change in Control or Sale</h5>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in  preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business  will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this  Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
        </p>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">4. Your Choices &amp; Obligations</h5>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">4.1 Data Retention</h5>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as  needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data  generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services  when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep  your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases, we choose to retain  certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated  form.
        </p>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data</h5>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from  deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of  your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you <span className = "privacyPolicyLink">settings</span> to  control, personalize and manage the personal data we have about you.
        </p>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          For personal data that we have about you, you can: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span className='privacyPolicyContentBold'>Delete Data:</span> You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g.,  if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className='privacyPolicyContentBold'>Change or Correct Data:</span> You can edit some of your personal data through your  account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix your data in certain cases,  particularly if it&acute;s inaccurate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className='privacyPolicyContentBold'>Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data:</span> You can ask us to stop using all or some  of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use  of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held). 
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className='privacyPolicyContentBold'>Right to Access and/or Take Your Data:</span> You can ask us for a copy of your personal  data and can ask for a copy of personal data you provided in machine readable form. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5 className="privacyPolicyInnerTitle">4.3 Account Closure</h5>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          If you choose to close your Nexdro account, your personal data will generally stop being  visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account  information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.
        </p>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably  necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests),  meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted your account for breach of our terms or policies), enforce  our User Agreement, or fulfil your request to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; from further messages from  us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
        </p>
        <p className='privacyPolicyContent'>
          Information you have shared with others (e.g., through updates or group posts) will  remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own  profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our  Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts  will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in  the services of others (e.g., search engine results) until they refresh their cache.
        </p>
